Description: TreeExp is an R package developed to provides useful phylogenetic tools applicable 
    to RNA-seq data. The package can be applied to comparative expression evolution analysis, which 
    includes but not liminited to: (i) pairwise expression distance estimation; (ii) relative rate 
    test for transcriptome evolution; (iii) the strength of expression conservation estimation; 
    (iv) ancestral transcriptome inference. Statistical methods implemented in the package was 
    based on Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of transcriptome evolution which claims that expression 
    changes are constrained by stabilizing selection.
