\title{Estimating gamma from taxaExp objects.}
\usage{
estgamma(objects = NULL, taxa = NULL, subtaxa = NULL,
  method = c("sou", "ced", "pea", "souln", "nbdln", "euc", "cos", "jsd"))
}
\arguments{
\item{objects}{a vector of objects of class \code{taxonExp} or an object of class \code{taxaExp}}

\item{taxa}{one single character or a vector of characters specifying main taxa selected for
calculating gammaD and gammaE.
If one single character "all" is given,
all the taxa included in the \code{taxaExp} will be matched and selected ("all" by default).}

\item{subtaxa}{one single character or a vector of characters sepcifying sub taxa selected for
calculating gammaD and gammaE.
#' If one single character "all" is given,
all the taxa included in the \code{taxaExp} will be matched and selected ("all" by default).}

\item{method}{specifying which distance method to be used
to estimate expression phylogeny in bootstrapping.}
}
\value{
returns a data frame of six columns, refer to details for more information.
