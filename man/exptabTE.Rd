\title{Expression level table from a \code{taxonExp} class}
\usage{
exptabTE(objects = NULL, taxa = "all", subtaxa = "all",
  rowindex = NULL, logrithm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{objects}{a vector of objects of class \code{taxonExp} or an object of class \code{taxaExp}}

\item{taxa}{one single character or a vector of characters specifying main taxa to be included in
the expression level table.
If one single character "all" is given,
all the taxa included in the \code{taxaExp} will be matched and included ("all" by default).}

\item{subtaxa}{one single character or a vector of characters specifying sub taxa to be included in
the expression level table.
If one single character "all" is given,
all the subtaxa included in the \code{taxaExp} will be matched and included ("all" by default).}

\item{rowindex}{a vector of numbers corresponded to indices of selecting rows}

\item{logrithm}{a logical specifying whether to apply expression value \code{log2} tranformation (TRUE by default).}
}
\value{
an expression level table: column corresponds to median expression value of all biological samples
within one 'taxa_subtaxa' group; row corresponds to othologous genes
}
\description{
Generate an expression level table from a \code{taxonExp} object
}
\examples{
data('tetraExp')
expression_table <- exptabTE(tetraExp, taxa = "all",subtaxa = "Brain")

}
